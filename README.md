# Binary Conversion Project

A desktop app with three mini-tools for number conversion and binary representation. It supports base conversion (2–16), signed integer encoding (VS, CA1, CA2), and includes a simple GUI with theme settings.

## Features

### ✅ 1. Base Conversion (Base A → Base B)
Convert any value from **base 2 to 16** into another:
- Input: Base A, Base B, and number
- Output: Converted value or validation errors

### ✅ 2. Signed Integer Representation
Convert integers to and from binary using:
- **VS** (Sign-Magnitude)  
- **CA1** (One's Complement)  
- **CA2** (Two's Complement)

Supports:
- `int → bin`
- `bin → int`
- Bit sizes: AUTO, 4, 8, 16

### ✅ 3. Float Representation
Convert floats to and from binary using:
- **IEEE 754**
- **Floating point**

### ✅ 3. GUI & Settings
- Built with **CustomTkinter**
- Navigation between mini-projects
- Light/Dark mode toggle
- Settings sidebar

## Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **CustomTkinter**

## Purpose
This project serves as a practical tool for learning and experimenting with binary systems, representations, and base conversions in a simple visual interface.
